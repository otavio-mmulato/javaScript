If you don't know me and are seeing my repository on GitHub for the first time, you might be asking yourself, "Why Diana?" and "Who the heck is Diana?"
Diana is my cockatiel, and I love her so much. So, when I feel bored or stressed while coding, I start creating combinations (Diana + a fun name related to the context).
It's also a way to keep my code safe from people looking for an easy way in. I love using this method, and my teachers do too.

So that's itâ€”every new Diana is incredible and unique! <3
